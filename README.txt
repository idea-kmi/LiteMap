We are currently in the process of merging in a newer copy of LiteMap.
All code that was previously in the /src folder, has been moved to the top level ready to merge into the latest running version.
Documentation will be updated soon. 


The below notes are out of date.

---------------------------------------------------


LiteMap - Release 1.0
==========================

<https://litemap.net/>.

Installation
------------ 

The 'docs' folder has the LiteMap Documentation which includes instructions for setting up a LiteMap instance (index.html). 
The 'src/install' folder has the sql for adding the required tables for the database (utf8 Database please) and the 
script for adding the default data to those tables.

Start by surfing to 'docs/index.html' and read the notes.
