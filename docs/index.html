<h2><a name="intro">Intro</a></h2>
<p>This is a really quick overview of the site structure with some
instructions further down on setting up the database and config file.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The LiteMap code base is released under the LGPL license: <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html</a>.<br>
It includes third party code which should all have licenses which are compatible with LGPL (see <b>/core/lib</b> and <b>/ui/lib</b> folders to view third party libraries used)</p>

<!-- p>If you need more help at present, please ask your questions through our <a href="http://evidence-hub.net/support/">LiteMap Reporting System</a></p -->

<h2><a name="requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
The LiteMap code has been developed and tested on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server using:
<br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">Apache 2.4.6.</h3>
Please add the following in your Apache config:<br><br>
	<code>Options All -Indexes -MultiViews
    <br>RewriteEngine on
    <br>AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig</code>

<br>LiteMap has embeddable iframes as part of its infastructure. Therefore LiteMap needs to have permissions set so the browsers allow LiteMap pages to be embedded in thrid party websites.

<br><br>If you have .htaccess files disabled (AllowOverride none), it will not affect the running of the site.
<br>Our .htaccess file has the following:
<br>

<pre>
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/javascript
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/x-js
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/json
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/ld+json
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/svg+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/truetype
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/opentype
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/vnd.ms-fontobject
</IfModule>

#RewriteEngine on
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/index-maintenance.php$
#RewriteRule $ /index-maintenance.php [R=302,L]

ErrorDocument 404 /404-error-page.php
ErrorDocument 403 /403-error-page.php
</pre>

<br>So we use it to compress files to speed up the website and for having site specific 404 and 403 pages.
<br>We also uncomment the  'Rewrite' lines if we want to put the site into maintenace mode
and display a holding page to the user (index-maintenace.php)

<br><br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">PHP version 5.4</h3>

mod_proxy_scgi mod_ssl mod_systemd mod_cgi mod_perl mod_php5 mod_apreq2</code>

<br><br>LiteMap is not necessarily dependent on all these modules. These are just what are installed on the server LiteMap was developed on.
I am unsure at this stage if any of them are non standard, or if the LiteMap code in anyway replies on them. So, just in case, I am listing them.
<br>
<br/>NOTE: In your php.ini make sure allow-url-fopen = on.
For importing and handling large CIF files, you may also want to set generous memory and timouts in PHP.

<br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">MySQL</h3>
LiteMap uses MySQL as the database at present.
So you will need to install MySQL on your server. We have developed and tested on MySQL (MariaDB): 5.5.
The database layer of the code has been abstracted out somewhat to make it eaiser for a developer to
extend the LiteMap code base to use a different database.

<br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">Email</h3>
LiteMap uses emails to validate account setups, tell users their registration is successful, send out email digests etc.
So your server should be able to do emailing if you want these to be sent.
You can switch off emailing with a setting in the config file if required (see <a href="#config">Config Settings</a>, below),
but then all accounts would need to be setup and validated by hand.

<br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">Crons</h3>
To send out the digest emails you will need to setup some cron jobs. An example is shown below.
To use the lines below you need to add the file system path to your LiteMap code where indicated
and the domain name to run then against (as LiteMap can be multi domain):

<br><br>0 1 * * 4 php <code>path to code</code>/core/cron/cron-follow-weekly.php <code>domain name</code>
<br><br>0 1 25 * * php <code>path to code</code>/core/cron/cron-follow-monthly.php <code>domain name</code>
<br><br>0 2 * * * php <code>path to code</code>/core/cron/cron-follow-daily.php <code>domain name</code>
<br><br>0 * * * *  php <code>path to code</code>/core/cron/cron-follow-hourly.php <code>domain name</code>
<br><br>0 0 15 * * php <code>path to code</code>/core/cron/cron-recent-activity.php <code>domain name</code>

<p>

<br>
<h2><a name="folders">A Quick What's Where in the 'src' folder</a></h2>
<p>The top level of the file structure has the main base config.php file,
(see below for more details on the domain level config file <a href="#config">Config Settings</a>) and the setup.php file.
</p>

<p>This level also has the files for the main pages of the site. These are:<br><br>
builder.php  - this is the web bookmarklet landing page,<br>
chats.php - the viewing chat pages,<br>
explore.php - for viewing a given entry,<br>
explore-slim.php - for viewing a given entry when on the map page,<br>
group.php - for viewing a group page,<br>
index.php - for viewing the main site page/starting point,<br>
map.php - for a viewing given map,<br>
knowledgetrees.php - for viewing a knowledge tree on the explore page,<br>
networkgraph.php - for viewing a network graph on the explore page,<br>
search.php - for viewing searhes, <br>
user.php - for viewing a given user</p>

<p>The majority of these top-level page should probably move to ui/pages in the future.</p>

<p><b>The Folders in 'src':</b></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">

<li><b>api </b> - This folder holds the LiteMap services file that processes incoming service request,

<h2><a name="setup">Setting up a LiteMap website</a></h2>

<ol>

<li><b>Creating the Database:</b>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
		<li>Create an empty database for the LiteMap to use in your MySQL installation,
		making sure that the database character set and collation are UTF-8, e.g.<br>
		<code>CREATE DATABASE dbname CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;</code><br><br>
		If you do not want to use utf8, you will need to edit the mysql.sql file before you run it in c. below, as the table creation statements are using utf8.</li>
		<li>Create a MySQL user for LiteMap to use.</li>
		<li>Load the database schema from /install/mysql.sql into your new LiteMap Database to create all the required tables.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Adding the Default Data:</b>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

		<li>Edit /install/adddefaultdata.php. You must fill in the following data in the file:
			<ul>
				<li>$dirAddress = the file path to where your website code resides on the server (ending in '/')</li>
				<li>$databaseaddress = the address of your mysql database - usually 'localhost';</li>
				<li>$databaseuser = the username of your mysql user for LiteMap, as created in step 1b above;</li>
				<li>$databasepass = the password of your mysql user for LiteMap, as created in step 1b above;</li>
				<li>$databasename = the name of your mysql database for LiteMap, as created in step 1a above;</li>
				<li>$email = fill in a default user email address for LiteMap - this can be made up. This user account owns the default node and links types and acts as a template for all subsequent user accounts;</li>
				<li>$password = fill in an default user password for LiteMap;</li>
				<li>$email2 = fill in a theme admin user email address for LiteMap - this can be made up. This user account manages the LiteMap News list and is called the System Admin user.</li>
				<li>$password2 = fill in an theme admin user password for LiteMap;</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Now run the adddefaultdata.php file on your server. You can do this in two ways:
			<ol>
				<li>Run it from the command line. Note that the file will output data that you will need, specifically two UserIDs and the deafult role group ID (as well as possible error messages).
				You can get the user ids you will need from the database Users table, adnd the deafult NodeTypeGroupID from the NodeTypeGroup table if required. But I would send the output to a file myself.</li>
				<li>Surf to the file through your browser. In this case the three ids you need for your config file will be displayed on screen as well as any error messages.</li>
			</ol>
		When it completes (hopefully without error) make a note of the ids it displays. You will need these in a moment to put in the Config file.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>Copy /config-sample.php to /config.php.
You will need to edit the config.php file here to just add two things:
<ol>
<li>$CFG->basedomain - this is the domain that is the default one for the installation. If you are running this as a single site this will be your actual domain.
For multi-sites you still need a base domain entered here. The details config.php file for this base domain can be found in 'sites/default/'.</li>
<li>$CFG->dirAddress - this is the file path on your server to the website code, ending in a '/'</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Copy sites/default/config-sample.php to sites/default/config.php.
<br>Edit settings in sites/default/config.php to point to your set up and database and to configure other important aspects of LiteMap.
<br/>For the setting $CFG-&gt;ADMIN_USERID, $CFG-&gt;defaultUserID and $CFG-&gt;defaultRoleGroupID you need to copy in the ids given from step 2c. above
<br/>All config file settings are explained below in <a href="config">Config Settings</a>.
<br/>The ones in <span style="color:red">red</span> represent the minimum settings that you must look at and edit as required.
</li>

<li>At this point you should be able to surf to the website and check it comes up OK.</li>

<li>If all is well, remove the <b>install</b> folder from your website.</li>

</ol>

<br>
<h2><a name="config">Config Settings</a></h2>

All setting have comments explaining their use.

<br/>( Does this site require login for all access, including interface and API; true if it does, else false if it does not.
This basically would lock down the site for access by non-logged in users.
You would need to really edit the login page to make it more of a landing page if you choose to set this to 'true', as the login page would be what people initally always see. ).

<br/>( This person is the owner of the News nodes in the system and you have to log in as them to manage themes. You will have been given this id as output from the install process.
Please note: by default News is not currently active on the homepage. So you would need to uncomment the News section to see andy News entriues you add through the 'admin' area.)

<br/><br/><b><span style="color:red">$CFG-&gt;defaultUserID = &quot;the database user id number of your Default user&quot;;</span></b>

<p>This is something we used when testing LiteMap with various user bases.
 It ties to an AuditTesting table in the database and various bits of code that can be
 used to write to this table when running tests.
 Search for $CFG->TEST_TRIAL_START in the code base to find examples of use from our last tests. There is a function in
 ui/util.js.php called auditTesting for writing to the AuditTesting table.
 You can ignore this unless you want to run a test of specific ui element's usage.<p>
<br/><b>$CFG-&gt;TEST_TRIAL_NAME = '';</b>

<br><br>
<h2><a name="language">Language</a></h2>

<p>The current language system allows you to do two important things:
<ol>
<li>Add another language: You can change the language you are using by translating all the language files into another language.</li>
<li>Site specific text: You can change the text in your version of the hub to be site specific.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">Adding another language</h3>
<p>If you want to add a new language set to the LiteMap you need to:
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder inside the 'language' folder whose name the two letter abbreviation for the language you are providing a translation for.
These codes are specified by the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">ISO 639</a> standard, e.g.</p>
<table style="width: 216px; height: 205px;" bgcolor="#cccccc" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr bgcolor="#3366ff">
<td valign="top"><em>Language Code</em></td>
<td valign="top"><em>Language</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>en</code></td>
<td>English</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fr</code></td>
<td>French</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>it</code></td>
<td>Italian</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>de</code></td>
<td>German</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>Copy the language files from inside the default 'en' language folder into your new folder.</li>
<li>Inside any given language file, each item is set up as a key/value pair, in the form key='value'.
You must translate/change only the values on the right hand side, NEVER change the key name on the left.</li>
<li>Change the language variables in the config file: <b>$CFG-&gt;language = 'en';</b> to reflect your new language of choice.
The <b>$CFG-&gt;language</b> setting must match the folder name for your new language.

</li>
</ol>
<p>NB: Some HTML is mixed up in the language files especially in the language heavy areas like the About and the Help pages.
<p>The languagecore.php file contains the node and link names used by other language files. It will always be loaded first so that other language files can refernece it.
</p>

<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline"><a name="sitetext">Site specific text</a></h3>

To provide site specific text for any of the interface languages you follow this basic pattern:
<ol>
<li>Locate the term you wish to replace in the language files.</li>
<li>Create a file with the same name as the file containing the term you wish to change and put it in the languages folder of sites/default or sites/multi/<your domain>, in the same structure e.g. sites/default/language/en/languageui.php.</li>
<li>Inside this new file you must use the same key label on the left as in the original file, and then just replace the part on the right after the '=' sign.
All domain specific files in the 'sites' language sub-folders are loaded after the main language files, and provided you have used the same keys, the text will be replaced with your version when the language files are loaded.</li>
</ol>
NOTE: If what you want to change any of the core terms, the names of the categories or links, for example, if you wish to call 'Themes' say 'Topics' instead on your Hub, you can just create a custom languagecore.php file
and change the text in that. These terms will ripple through the rest of the interface text as all the rest of the text should reference those terms through their keys.
This makes it easy to change the basic terminology for a given Hub community without editing lots of interface text.
<br><br>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> There are two none-standard items in the language folder that are not handled in the same way as the other language files:
<ol>
<li>The <b>countries.php</b> file: This holds the country names used in the location drop-down menus displayed to users.
It is also the place where you set your default country when displaying the list ($LNG-&gt;DEFAULT_COUNTRY=).
When translating these, please, as with the other files change only the part on the right after the '='.
NOTE: this file may need updating if new countries come into existence.
The location of where to check for updates is in the file header.</li>
<li>The <b>mailtemplates</b> folder: The files inside this folder are used when constructing the emails send out to users.
When translating them please change only the words and leave all HTML alone, unless you know what you are doing.
Be especially careful about leaving all <b>%s</b> items alone.
These are replace with specific text when an email is created.
So the number of <b>%s</b> and their order in the file is very important. Please don't remove any or that email will no longer be written correctly.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="lang">Tailoring your LiteMap</a></h2>
At present, if you want to change the look and feel or text of your LiteMap site,these are the main places you should look at making changes:
<ul>
<li><b>Themes:</b> The style sheets for the ui can be found in 'themes/default/styles/'. Please don't edit those ones.
If you want to create your own theme you should copy the 'default' folder, rename it and edit the styles there.
In the images folder you will see some image files like the header logo etc, that you will also probably want to replace.
Just make sure the files names and sizes stay the same. In addition you can override themes for a given domain or the default domain in the 'sites' folder.
For more information see the README.txt file in the 'themes' folder.</li>
<li><b>Language:</b> All text displayed in LiteMap has been placed in various files in the 'language' folder system.
So you can override all the default texts your specific site needs.
You may especially like to add to or redo the <b>about</b> page (language/en/about.php and help.php pages).
(See the <a href="#language">Language</a> section of these notes for more details and there is also a README.txt file in the 'language' folder).</li>
<li><b>Homepage:</b> The file that draws the homepage (ui/homepage.php) is in the 'ui' folder. While all the text can be
changed through the language files, you may want to completely redo this page for your specific version of LiteMap.</li>
<li><b>Images:</b> The theme specific images can be found in the themes as mentioned above.
All other icons and images can be found in the 'images' folder. If you want to replace an image make sure the size and file name stay the same
and you will not need to edit any code. We suggest you backup the images folder before you make changes.</li>
<li><b>Headers and Footers:</b> The header and footer files can be found in the 'ui' folder.
The main 'header.php' and 'footer.php' do the base site pages, but you will see there are also specific header and footer pages
for other parts of the site, like popup dialogs and the embeds etc., so you may want to look at all of them when making any changes.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="dev">Additional Developer Notes</a></h2>

<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline"><a name="sitetext">RESTful API</a></h3>
LiteMap has a RESTful API. This returns jsonld formatted data in the <a href="http://purl.org/catalyst/jsonld" target="_blank"> Catalyst Interchange Format</a>.
<br/>The main use patterns are:<br/>
<br/> 'your website address/api/views/map id number' - for getting maps
<br/> 'your website address/api/conversations/group id' - for getting all maps in a group

<br/><br/>
<p>There is a jsonld icon button on group and map pages to get the api url for that group or map. The code handling these requests
can be found in 'api/restapi.php'.
Note also there is a .htaccess file in the 'api' folder which directs between the RESTful api calls and the ui RPCs</p>

<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline"><a name="sitetext">Database Schema</a></h3>
<p>As well as the install/mysql.sql file which has the sql for the database schema, there are two additional documents:
<ul>
	<li><a href="LiteMapSchemaDocs.htm">'docs/LiteMapSchemaDocs.htm'</a>, which describes the schema in an easy to read format.</li>
	<li><a href="LiteMapDatabaseSchemaDrawing.pdf">'docs/LiteMapDatabaseSchemaDrawing.pdf'</a>, which shows a graphics model of the LiteMap database schema and how the tables relate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline"><a name="sitetext">Datamodel Rules</a></h3>
<p>If you are interested in the connection rules for the Datamodel that LiteMap uses these are listed in <a href="LiteMapDatamodelConnectionRules.pdf">'docs/LiteMapDatamodelConnectionRules.pdf'</a>

<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline"><a name="sitetext">README</a></h3>
<p>In addition to this document many folders in 'src' have a README.txt
file with specifics about areas like 'sites', 'sites/multi', 'sites/default', 'sites/default/custom' etc..</p>

<h3 style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline"><a name="sitetext">Translating the Interface</a></h3>
<p>The file <a href="Language-File-Translation-Help.docx">docs/Language-File-Translation-Help.docx</a>
has more specific help for people translating the language files.
