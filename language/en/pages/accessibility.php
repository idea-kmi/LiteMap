<h2>How accessible this website is</h2>

<p>We strive to exceed current accessibility standards. However, we know some elements of 
Open University websites are not fully accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some third-party content not created by The Open University.</li>
<li>Sites linked from Open University pages but not run by the Open University.</li>
<li>Some activities (for example some of those involving maps, charts, graphs, online-experiments, interactive activities and features).</li>
<li>Some content with specialised notations, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and music.</li>
<li>Older PDFS and Word documents may not be fully accessible to screen reader software.</li>
<li>The colour contrast for some text and some interface components (for example search boxes, check boxes) is not sufficient.</li>
<li>Some online forms are not set up correctly to include helpful direction for screen reader users.</li>
</ul>

<p>We aim to provide accessible alternative content or activities where we can.

<h2>Compliance status</h2>

<p>This website is partially compliant with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>
&nbsp;AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Non accessible content</h2>

<h3>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

<p>Current web technology is not capable of ensuring the accessibility of specialised notations (e.g., mathematics, chemistry, physics, music, phonetics etc.). We are monitoring developments in these areas and will improve our services as the technology matures.</p>
<p>Some online activities cannot be made fully accessible (e.g., categorising an image). Wherever practical, an alternative activity will be provided.</p>
<p>The level of accessibility during live events is limited. We are working closely with third-party suppliers and improving our internal systems to improve accessibility during live events.</p>
<p>The Open University provides links to external websites that may not meet accessibility standards.</p>

<h6><strong>Current Accessibility issues:</strong></h6>

<h4>Level A</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Clickable controls should be keyboard accessible.</li>
	<li>Clickable controls should have an ARIA role.</li>
	<li>Document must have a title.</li>
	<li>Elements with <code>role=tablist</code> must contain or own an element with <code>role=tab</code> and must not contain elements with other roles.</li>	
	<li>Identify row and column headers in data tables using <code>th</code> elements, and mark layout tables with <code>role=presentation</code>.</li>
	<li><code>img</code> elements must have an accessible name.</li>
	<li>Links must have an accessible name.</li>
	<li>Some pages have the same <code>title</code>, so the title cannot be used to distinguish pages.</li>
	<li>Some elements use JavaScript to behave like a link. Links like this cannot be tabbed to from the keyboard and are not read out when screen readers list the links on a page.</li>
	<li>Use semantic markup like <code>strong</code> instead of using the CSS <code>font-weight</code> property.</li>
	<li>Use the <code>lang</code> attribute to identify the language of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level AA</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure that text and background colors have enough contrast.</li>
	<li>Need to provide two or more ways to reach each page: via links, search, a site map or table of contents.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level AAA</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid specifying a new window as the target of a link with <code>target=_blank</code>.</li>
	<li>Clickable targets must be at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels.</li>
	<li>Each section of content should begin with a heading element ( <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> ), but this page has no headings.</li>
	<li>Ensure that text and background colors have a 7:1 contrast ratio.</li>
	<li>Several links on a page share the same link text, but go to different destinations.</li>
</ul>
