/** LITEMAP SITES **/

You can run a single site version of LiteMap by configuring a copy of 'config-sample.php' file inside the 'default' folder.
1.	Inside the 'default'folder, copy the 'config-sample.php' file and call it 'config.php'.
2.	Edit the config.php and change the settings as instructed.

You can run multiple instances of LiteMap for different domains from the same code base using the multi-sites system. 
See the README.txt file inside the 'multi' folder for more details.
