To add a new domain to the multi-domain system:

1.	Copy the folder '-- domain-template-folder --' to a new folder and
	name the new folder with exactly the same name as the new domain being added, 
	e.g. if the new domain is 'http://xyz.com' then the folder must be called 'xyz.com'.
2.	Inside your new domain folder, copy the 'config-sample.php' file and call it 'config.php'.
3.	Edit the config.php and change the settings as instructed.
4.	If required add a new theme in the 'theme' folder, 
	(see the README.txt file in 'theme' folder for more info).
5.	If required override interface text elements or add a new language translation in the
	'language' folder, (see the README.txt file in 'language' folder for more info).
6.	If required override any code to make local customizations in the 'custom' folder, 
	(see the README.txt file in 'custom' folder for more info).
