## 2.1.10
* Update dependencies, including crossfilter2 v1.4
* Example of adding a vertical line to a row chart

## 2.1.9
* Fix selectMenu crashing IE11 on Windows 8 and below, by Victor Parpoil ([#1338](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1338) / [#1334](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1334))

## 2.1.8
(see 2.0.5)

## 2.1.7
* viewBox-based resizing of charts, by James Tindall ([#1312](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1312))
* workaround for [issue #949](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/949) merged from 2.0.4
* remove pointless and confusing optimization from number display - it now uses `computeOrderedGroups` like everything else.

## 2.1.6
* fix test syntax for Microsoft browsers

## 2.1.5
* crossfilter is loaded by its module name (crossfilter2), not its filename (crossfilter). This is intended to help webpack and other automatic module loaders. This is likely to break requireJS configurations; see [#1304](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1304) for details. ([#1213](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1213), [#1214](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1214), [#1261](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1261), [#1293](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1293), [#1302](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1302))
 * Default capMixin.ordering to sort decreasing by value, to emulate old group.top(N)
 * `numberDisplay` should pick the highest value in the case where it is given a regular group

## 2.1.4
 * Simplified `capMixin.othersGrouper` default implementation by passing the rest of the items as well as those before the cap. This is possible because of [#934](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/934) relying on sorting of `group.all()` instead of `group.top()`. The default implementation is now easy to understand and it should be easier to customize (if anyone should want to).
 * Added example filtering segments of stack ([#657](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/657))

## 2.1.3
 * 2.1.2 did not observe the common convention of having the rows/pie slices ordered from greatest to least - now we take from the front by default. ([#1296](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1296)
 * Add [`takeFront`](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/dc.capMixin.html#takeFront) option, defaulted true, in case you want to take from the back isntead.
 * Remove `component.json`, since [component-js has been deprecated for a long time](https://github.com/componentjs/component/issues/639) (actually it got deprecated immediately after we added this in [#860](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/860))

## 2.1.2
 * Lift `elasticRadius` from `bubbleChart` to `bubbleMixin`, making it available to `bubbleOverlay` ([#661](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/661))
Stop using `group.top()` in favor of `group.all()` sorting and slicing. ([#934](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/934))
 * Eliminate use of `group.top()` in cap mixin, by Macy Abbey ([#1184](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1184)). It already had to agree with `chart.ordering()` for the results to make sense.
 * Eliminate `group.top()` in number display. This one is more problematic but probably less common. Although the number display now defaults ordering to `function (kv) { return kv.value; }`, applications which use a group with multiple bins with the number display, which were using `group.order()` to specify which bin should be displayed, must now specify `numberDisplay.ordering()` instead.
 * Eliminate `group.top()` in bubble mixin, which was used to draw the bubbles in descending order of size, when the `group.order()` specified the radius. The bubble chart's `sortBubbleSize` is more general and is lifted to the mixin.

## 2.1.1
 * Merges 2.0.1

## 2.1.0
 * `dc.selectMenu`, implementing a `<select>` menu or multiple-select widget, by Andrea Singh ([#771](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/771))
 * Heatmap allows customizing the ordering separately from the values, by Matt Traynham ([#869](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/869) - thanks also to Quinn Lee for [#837](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/837))
 * Front page stable version automatically read from GitHub, by Enrico Spinielli ([#865](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/865))
 * Functional-style filter handlers: instead of modifying the array of filters in-place, filter handlers must return the new filter array. This is consistent with the old documention, but a different implementation: any changes to the `filters` argument will be ignored unless they are returned. This should make filter handlers easier to reason about.

# 2.0 Series
## 2.0.5
* legend highlighting functions of scatter plots would select symbols in sibling charts, causing the symbols and sizes to change ([#874](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/874))

## 2.0.4
* Temporary flag [`stackMixin.evadeDomainFilter`](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/dc.stackMixin.html#evadeDomainFilter__anchor) to work around [issue #949](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/949) until it's fixed. The flag completely disables filtering of points by the stack mixin, because the current filtering is wrong. (The correct fix will be included in dc.js 2.1.x when it's ready.)

## 2.0.3
* crossfilter is loaded by its module name (crossfilter2), not its filename (crossfilter). This is intended to help webpack and other automatic module loaders. This is likely to break requireJS configurations; see [#1304](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1304) for details. ([#1213](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1213), [#1214](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1214), [#1261](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1261), [#1293](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1293), [#1302](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1302))
* Do not make the pie chart radius bigger than the chart size, by Sandeep Fatangare ([#1279](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1279))
* Allow custom scatter plot symbols ([#1274](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1274))
* Download example sorts the table data in the same order as it's shown ([#1232](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1232))
* `baseChart.replaceFilter` should return the chart ([#1227](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1227))

## 2.0.2
* Allow bracketed selectors for charts to work with numeric/quoted values, by Marcel Pfeiffer ([#1282](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1282))
* Fix images in [European Parliament example](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/ep/), by Xavier Dutoit ([#1284](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1284) / [#1256](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1256))
* Add `seriesChart` to [class hierarchy in HTML docs](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/).

## 2.0.1
* `sans-serif` was specified as a string, which is invalid, by Kyle Doherty ([#1260](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1260))

## 2.0.0
* xAxisPaddingUnit also applied to stacked charts, by Alexander Stillesjö ([#1234](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1234)
* Limit zoom bounds - panning past the end should not cause brush to turn inside out. Thanks to Indri Muska for initial implementation and test ([#1026](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1026))
* Legend was wrapping one item too late, by alexnb ([#1229](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1229))
* Limit the number of legend items with `maxItems`, by Renoth ([#1114](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1114))
* [Example of switching time intervals](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/examples/switching-time-intervals.html), for doing simple aggregation of simple time series data
* Scatter plot titles, by Daniel Gall ([#1200](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1200))
* `scatterPlot` and `RangedTwoDimensionalFilter` no longer require that the dimension key have exactly two elements, to support the common trick of putting the color in the third element.
* [Scatter plot matrix brushing example](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/examples/splom.html)
* `emptyOpacity` is exposed, and `emptySize` is a radius like the other sizes (squared for symbol size), by Ganesh Iyer ([#1058](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1058))
* Bubble chart and heatmap correctly re-select (not selectAll) the sub-components in order to correctly apply new data when redrawn. This affects uses of dc.js where the data is replaced instead of being modified in place. (For example, the case where crossfilter is not used.) By Steffen Dienst and Matt Traynham. ([#1032](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1032), [#1237](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1237))
* Further changed other unnecessary uses of `selectAll` to `select` - when appending or inserting a single element, one should almost always match that with `select` for updates. ([#1239](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1239))
* Heatmap column/row filtering is a lot faster ([#649](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/649))
* `colorMixin.colorCalculator` properly documented and deprecated ([#1225](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1225))
* Development dependencies upgraded, by Matt Traynham ([#1233](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1233))
* Add a class diagram to the [HTML documentation](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/).
* Many documentation fixes. ([#612](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/612), [#636](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/636), [#1110](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1110), [#1224](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1224), [#1226](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1226), [#1228](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1228), [#1231](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1231), [#1235](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1235))

* Don't try to interpolate user data in label paths, by Alexander Stillesjö ([#1151](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1151))
* Allow specifying the unit for padding the X axis, by Alexander Stillesjö (thanks also to Matt Traynham for the alternate implementation in [#892](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/892))
* Force dots to be shown with `.xyTipsOn('always')`, by Anders Dalvander ([#1152](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1152))
* Use keyAccessor for box plots; fix ordinal boxplot brushing and whisker widths, by Matt Traynham ([#1022](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1022))
* `transitionDelay` allows staggered transitions, by Mauricio Bustos ([#1116](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1116))
* Removed the confusing callback from dc.transition and documented the function

## 2.0.0 beta 32
* `elasticY` and `elasticX` did not work if all values were negative (coordinate grid and row charts, respectively), by Sebastian Gröhn ([#879](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/879) / [#1156](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1156))
* Improved implementation of alignYAxes, by Mohamed Gazal and Gordon Woodhull ([#1033](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1033))
* Examples of downloading the table data as it's formatted, and formatting legend items.

* Highlight pie slices when hovering labels and paths. (addressing a concern raised in commit [0a35ef61](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1167/commits/0a35ef61568baf8e84e0bc489f678df560dc7f31) in PR [#1167](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1167), but in a more robust way)
* Transition dots in line chart, by Paul Mach ([#1181](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1181))

* Example of workaround for using series chart as a range chart ([#479](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/479))

## 2.0.0 beta 30
* Fix the doc build, which was crashing due to an impolite library and the upgrade of another one that knew nothing about it ([#1142](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1142))
* Strip fragment from URL before creating clip path URL ([#1079](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1079))

## 2.0.0 beta 29
* Fix node/browserify require(crossfilter2) again (first fix was lost in merge). Thanks Timothy Pfafman! ([#1133](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1133))

## 2.0.0 beta 28
* Line chart labels, by Mohamed Gazal ([#1045](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1045))

* Ability to set color and opacity of non-brushed ("excluded") points in scatterplot; also separate brushing from highlighting, which seems like a different thing. ([#938](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/938))

## 2.0.0 beta 26
* Apply pie chart labels before transition, so they are easier to manipulate with the pretransition hook. Added example of showing percentages in pie chart labels. (Workaround for [#703](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/703))
* Documentation of chart registry, by Jasmine Hegman ([#676](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/676) / [#1082](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1082))
* HTML documentation generation, by Matt Traynham. There are still some kinks to be worked out here, but in principle it should be more robust than the gigantic markdown file we are generating. ([#1086](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1086))
* Document that you need to use a `RangedFilter` when filtering a range, by koefoed ([#1090](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1090))

* Example of [complex reductions](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/examples/complex-reduce.html) that need all the rows in each group, like min, max, median.
* [Time interval](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/examples/time-intervals.html) example.

## 2.0.0 beta 25
* Improved dataTable docs (including a fix for [#1030](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1030))
* Generate proper data table header ([#1015](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1015))
* Fix various test failures on Safari/IE/Edge (regular testing is on Chrome/Firefox/Opera) ([#1072](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1072), [#1073](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1073), [#1074](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1064))

## 2.0.0 beta 24
* Only auto-calculate width/height once each render - sizes were getting calculated wrong ([#1070](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1070)) and charts were changing size on redraw if they didn't have a fixed size in the chart spec or in the div style ([#980](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/980))
* Tell browserify the correct entry point `browser: dc.js`, so it won't try to bundle jsdom, by Sam Dunster ([#1005](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1005) / ([#1062](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1062))

## 2.0.0 beta 22
(no changes; bump due to botched npm publish)

## 2.0.0 beta 21
* Ability to use non-crossfilter backend with asynchronous connection (callback), via `commitHandler`.
* Domain comparison was failing for undefined/null domain values.
* Option `controlsUseVisibility` to use `visibility` attribute instead of `display` for `filter` and `reset` controls, to reduce disruption to the layout. Was originally on 2.1 branch with default true, now on 2.0 branch with default false. ([#888](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/888), [#1016](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1016))
* Option to add labels above bars in bar chart (e.g. to show the value), by N Reese ([#211](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/211) / [#1031](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1031))

* Further documentation improvements, including lots more cross-linking, by Matt Traynham ([#1012](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1012))
* Minified CSS, by Indri Muska ([#1023](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1023))

## 2.0.0 beta 19
* Allow d3.selection to be passed as parent, as documented ([#1006](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1006))
* Properly derive dc.errors from Error prototype to get stack
* Add BadArgumentException and make .anchor() parent argument mandatory
* Enable crossfilter optimizations by not resetting the filter and by using filterExact and filterRange, by Ethan Jewett ([#990](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/990) / [#989](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/989) / [#478](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/478))

* Fix method name in documentation ([#1009](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1009))
* Move x axis when row chart size changes, by Wang Xuan ([#1001](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1001)
* Fix css rule that was improperly selecting all axes, not just dc.js ones ([#1011](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/1011) / ([#1005](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1007))
* Add pre-commit hook to hopefully avoid ever checking in merge artifacts again.

## 2.0.0 beta 18
* Fixes resizing examples to use `rescale` - currently all coordinate grid charts need to call this when changing width/height, in order to get axes moved ([#974](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/974))
* Update all dependencies, continued linting, by Matt Traynham ([#975](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/975))

## 2.0.0 beta 16
* Reposition brush when coordinate grid chart size changes ([#972](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/972))
* Ability to slice the data grid, by Chris Alvino ([#946](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/946)). Also a much-needed warning that data table and data grid `.group()` means something completely different.
* Ability not to apply grouping to data table, by Emiliano Guevara ([#863](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/863))

## 2.0.0 beta 15
* Reposition X axis on chart resize, by Rob Hardwick ([#856](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/856)). Y axis as well
* More fixes for resizing charts, and [a new resizing examples directory](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/resizing/), mostly for testing.

## 2.0.0 beta 14

## Starting dc.js Changelog
 * Here we start using git-flow, start a changelog, and start 2015.  Under git-flow,
   the latest release (starting with 2.0.0-beta.1) is always on the master branch,
   development (2.1.0-dev) is on the develop branch, and releases and fixes are always
   merged into develop.
 * Read about git-flow here: http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/
 * It follows that this document will always have two active sections: the master
   section, and the develop section.  Since any changes merged to master are also
   merged to develop, any changes added to the changelog for the master branch will
   get merged into the same section in the develop version of this document.
